# flashcards
Desktop app made in Java for making learning cards with a python script to try to make automated cards with AI parsing a pdf file
collabed with my colleagues on college here is the repo link https://github.com/PaulaIvanovic/Projekt-FlashCards
I made the backend CRUDE, login, register features, a bit of frontend and the whole python script that uses AI to try to parse PDF-s
